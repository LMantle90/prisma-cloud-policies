  "description": "GCP Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets storing GCP Vertex AI training pipeline output models could pose a significant security risk. These models represent sensitive intellectual property, and their exposure could lead to unauthorized access and intellectual property theft.\n\nGCP Vertex AI training pipelines output models are stored in GCS buckets. Incorrect bucket access configurations, such as publicly accessible permissions, allow unauthorized individuals or malicious actors to download and potentially misuse these sensitive models. This exposes the organization to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and potential financial losses.\n\nUnauthorized access to these models could result in significant financial and reputational damage. Maintaining strict access control over GCS buckets containing sensitive AI models is crucial for data protection and preventing malicious exploitation. Implementing robust access controls reduces the risk of data breaches and safeguards intellectual property.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, enforce the principle of least privilege. Configure GCS buckets with private access, granting only necessary permissions to authorized users and services. Regularly audit bucket access controls and proactively identify and remediate any misconfigurations.",
