Select the \"Alert ID\", then \"Investigate\"\n2. In the results, you will see the resource, the service account attached to it (\"Granted By Entity\"), the policy granting unused administrative permissions to the service account (\"Granted By Policy\"), the specific unused permissions (\"Destination\"), and the last recorded event when the permissions were used by the user (\"Last Access\"). Prisma Cloud's event tracking period begins upon onboarding. As such, depending on the onboarding date, further investigation may be required using the cloud provider logs to determine last access\nOnce examining the permissions and the service account, use the following remediation steps:\nLog in to your Cloud instance, and navigate to the affected service account. If the service account is deemed to be necessary, edit the entity's permissions following the principle of least privilege and based on the information collected. If the service account is not required, remove it",
