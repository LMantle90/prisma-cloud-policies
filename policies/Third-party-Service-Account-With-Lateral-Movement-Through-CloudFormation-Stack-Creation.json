  "description": "This policy identifies third-party vendors with permissions to both pass IAM roles ('iam:PassRole') and create CloudFormation stacks ('cloudformation:CreateStack'). These permissions enable vendors to establish new CloudFormation stacks and assign them highly privileged roles. Such actions could allow these external entities to escalate their privileges within your AWS environment, posing a serious security risk",
