  "name": "Azure Cosmos DB (PaaS) instance with network path from the untrust internet source",
  "description": "Azure Cosmos DB instances accessible from untrusted internet sources pose a significant security risk. Direct internet exposure allows unauthorized access attempts, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.\n\nAzure Cosmos DB's network configuration should restrict access to only trusted IP addresses or virtual networks. Failing to implement this leaves the database vulnerable to brute-force attacks, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, and unauthorized data modification or exfiltration. Untrusted internet access increases the attack surface and compromises data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nA misconfiguration allowing untrusted internet access can result in data breaches, service disruption, and significant financial and reputational damage. Restricting access to trusted sources ensures only authorized entities can interact with the database, minimizing the risk of compromise. This best practice enhances the security posture and protects sensitive data.\n\nMitigate this risk by configuring Azure Cosmos DB to accept connections only from trusted IP addresses or virtual networks. Implement robust authentication mechanisms and regularly review and update your allowed IP list. Consider leveraging Azure Virtual Networks for enhanced network segmentation and control.",

Sign in to the Azure Portal using your Azure account credentials\n2. Navigate to the Azure Cosmos DB Dashboard\n3. Identify the reported Azure Cosmos DB instances that you want to restrict public access\n4. Navigate to the 'Networking' section\n5. Under 'Public network access' select 'Selected networks'\n6. Under the 'Firewall' section, add the IP addresses or IP address ranges of the trusted sources in CIDR form in 'IP (Single IPv4 or CIDR range)'\n7. Click 'Save' to apply the changes",
