  "description": "This policy identifies Object Storage buckets that have write-level logging disabled.\n\nEnabling write-level logging for Object Storage provides more visibility into changes to objects in your buckets. Without write-level logging, there is no record of changes made to the bucket. This lack of visibility can lead to undetected data breaches, unauthorized changes, and compliance violations.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to enable write-level logging on Object Storage buckets.",
