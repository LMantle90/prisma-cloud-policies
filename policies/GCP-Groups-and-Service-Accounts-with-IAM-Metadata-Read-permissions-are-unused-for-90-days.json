  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Groups and Service Accounts with Stale IAM Effective Metadata Read Permissions.\n\nRisk of Unused Metadata Read Permissions:\nEven seemingly low-risk permissions like \"Metadata Read\" in GCP IAM can be problematic if left unused for extended periods. Unused GCP groups and service accounts with IAM effective Metadata Read permissions for 90 days present a security concern because:\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker with access to these credentials could use them to gather sensitive details about your GCP environment. This information could include project structures, VM types and locations, or network configurations. Attackers could exploit this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities or plan more targeted attacks against your VMs or other resources.\nPotential Lateral Movement Path: A compromised unused group or service account with Metadata Read permissions could be a stepping stone for attackers. They might leverage this access to discover and exploit further vulnerabilities within your GCP project, potentially leading to unauthorized access to more sensitive data or systems.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Regularly identify and remove unused GCP groups and service accounts with any level of IAM effective Metadata access (Read or Write) on a scheduled basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM permissions. Grant only the minimum level of Metadata Read access required for a group or service account to function effectively. Evaluate if alternative methods, like IAM conditions or service account key restrictions, can restrict access to specific VMs or projects.\nMonitor for Suspicious Activity: Utilize Stackdriver Logging to track activity logs, including access attempts for GCP groups and service accounts. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused accounts that might indicate a compromise.",
