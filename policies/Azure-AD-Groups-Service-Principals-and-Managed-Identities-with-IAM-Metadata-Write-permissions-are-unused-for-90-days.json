  "description": "This policy identifies Azure AD Groups, Service Principals, and Managed Identities with Stale IAM Effective Metadata Write Permissions.\n\nRisk of Unused Metadata Write Permissions:\nAzure AD groups, service principals, and managed identities with Unused IAM effective Metadata Write permissions for 90 days pose a security risk because:\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker with access to these identities could leverage them to gather details about your Azure environment. This information could include virtual machine (VM) configurations, resource locations, or network security groups. Attackers could exploit this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities or plan further intrusions.\nPotential Privilege Escalation: If compromised, unused identities with Metadata Write permissions could be used by attackers to escalate privileges within your Azure environment. They might exploit these permissions to gain control of VMs or manipulate virtual networks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to more sensitive data or systems.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Proactively identify and remove unused Azure AD groups, service principals, and managed identities with any level of IAM effective Metadata access (Read or Write) on a regular basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Always adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions. Grant only the minimum level of Metadata Write access required for an identity to function effectively. Evaluate if alternative methods, like Managed Identity access restrictions, can limit access to specific VMs or resource groups.\nMonitor for Unusual Activity: Utilize Azure Monitor to track activity logs, including access attempts for Azure AD identities. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused identities that might indicate a compromise.",
