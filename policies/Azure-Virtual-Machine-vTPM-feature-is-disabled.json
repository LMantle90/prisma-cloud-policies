  "description": "This policy identifies Virtual Machines that have Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) feature disabled. Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) provide enhanced security to the guest operating system. It is recommended to enable virtual TPM device on supported virtual machines to facilitate measured Boot and other OS security features that require a TPM.\n\nNOTE: This assessment only applies to trusted launch enabled virtual machines. You can't enable trusted launch on existing virtual machines that were initially created without it. \nTo know more, refer https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Security",
