  "description": "Publicly readable AWS S3 buckets allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. This misconfiguration exposes data to anyone with knowledge of the bucket name, potentially leading to data breaches and reputational damage.\n\nThe S3 service lacks inherent namespace protection; improperly configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies enable unintended read access. Attackers can exploit this to download or list bucket contents, compromising sensitive information. Failure to implement appropriate security measures increases the risk of data exfiltration.\n\nA data breach resulting from this misconfiguration could expose confidential customer data, intellectual property, or other sensitive information. Implementing strong access controls is critical to protecting data confidentiality and integrity. Maintaining a secure configuration reduces the likelihood of a successful attack.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, enforce least privilege by restricting access to only authorized users and services. Regularly review and update bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they align with security best practices. Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect unauthorized access attempts. Consider using server-side encryption to further protect data at rest.",

Under 'Bucket Policy', Select 'Edit Bucket Policy' and consider defining what explicit 'Principal' should have the ability to GET/LIST objects in your S3 bucket. You may also want to specifically limit the 'Principal' ability to perform specific GET/LIST functions, without the wild card.\nIf 'Bucket Policy' is not required delete the existing 'Bucket Policy'.\nb.
