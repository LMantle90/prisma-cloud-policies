  "description": "This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances with network path from the untrust internet source on ports with high risk.\n\nAWS EC2 instances with network path from the untrust internet source on ports with high risk increases the risk of unauthorized access, cyber attacks, and data breaches, as it may provide a larger attack surface for malicious actors. Such instances are especially prone to brute force or vulnerability exploits.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to allow access from Trusted IP list and limit the access from known hosts, services, or specific entities.\n\nNOTE: Prisma Cloud Trusted IP List allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.",
