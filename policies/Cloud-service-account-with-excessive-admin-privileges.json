  "description": "Identifies cloud service accounts in Azure, AWS and GCP which have administrative permissions that have not been used in the last 90 days. As opposed to user accounts, service accounts are predictable. Therefore, if a service account has administrative permissions which it has not used in the past 90 days, we can confidently say it does not require them, and remove the permissions, decreasing the blast radius in case of a compromise of the service account.",
