  "description": "This policy identifies Azure AD Identities with Unused Data Read Permissions.\n\nEven seemingly low-risk permissions like \"Data Read\" in Azure Active Directory (AAD) can be problematic if left unused for 90 days. Here's why:\n\nInformation Gathering: An attacker could exploit these credentials to gather sensitive information about your Azure environment. This data could include details about storage accounts, databases, or other resources containing sensitive information. Attackers can use this information to identify vulnerabilities or plan further attacks.\nCompromise Stepping Stone: Unused identities with Data Read permissions can be a stepping stone for attackers. They might use them to learn about your environment's layout and identify other resources or users to target for further compromise.\nWhile Data Read itself doesn't allow direct data manipulation, the information gleaned can be valuable for attackers. Here's how to mitigate the risk:\n\nRegular Review and Removal: Identify and disable unused Azure AD identities with any level of Data access (Read or Write) on a regular basis.\nLeast Privilege: Grant only the minimum permissions required for a user or machine identity to function. Data Read should only be assigned if absolutely necessary.\nMonitor forSuspicious Activity: Utilize Azure Monitor to track activity logs, including access attempts for Azure AD identities. This can help detect unusual activity related to unused accounts that might indicate a compromise.",
