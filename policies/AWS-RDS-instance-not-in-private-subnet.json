Open the Amazon RDS console\n2. In the navigation pane, choose 'Subnet groups'\n3. Choose 'Create DB Subnet Group'\n4. Type the 'Name' of your DB subnet group\n5. Add a 'Description' for your DB subnet group\n6. Choose your 'VPC'\n7. Choose 'Availability Zones'\n8. In the Add subnets section, add your Private subnets related to this VPC\n9. Choose Create\n\nWhen creating your RDS DB, under Configure advanced settings, choose the Subnet group created above.",
