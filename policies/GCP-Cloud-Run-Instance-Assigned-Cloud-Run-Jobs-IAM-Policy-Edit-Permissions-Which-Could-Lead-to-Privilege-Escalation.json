  "description": "An adversary able to edit the IAM policy for Cloud Run Jobs, in conjunction with Service Account impersonation privileges would be able to escalate their permissions by adding edit permissions to an instance, causing it to perform attacker controlled actions using the permissions of an impersonated Service Account. This would allow them to further enumerate and exploite the environment.",
