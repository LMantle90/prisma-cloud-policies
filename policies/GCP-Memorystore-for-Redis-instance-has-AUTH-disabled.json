  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Memorystore for Redis instances having AUTH disabled.\n\nGCP Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store that simplifies Redis deployment and scaling while ensuring high availability and low-latency access. When AUTH is disabled, any client that can reach the Redis instance over the network can freely connect and perform operations without providing any credentials, creating a significant security risk to your data.\n\nIt is recommended to enable authentication (AUTH) on the GCP Memorystore for Redis to ensure only authorized clients can connect.",
