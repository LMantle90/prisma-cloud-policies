  "description": "This policy identifies the AWSCloudShellFullAccess policy attached to IAM roles, users, or IAM groups. AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services. The 'AWSCloudShellFullAccess' IAM policy, providing unrestricted CloudShell access, poses a risk of data exfiltration, allowing malicious admins to exploit file upload/download capabilities for unauthorized data transfer. As a security best practice, it is recommended to grant least privilege access like granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excessive permissions.",
