  "description": "An attacker who successfully exploits a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the web service can leverage the permissions associated with the App Engine service. By creating Cloud Function instances with service account impersonation privileges, the attacker can escalate their permissions. This enables the creation of instances that perform actions under the guise of the impersonated service account, further allowing the attacker to enumerate and exploit the environment.",
