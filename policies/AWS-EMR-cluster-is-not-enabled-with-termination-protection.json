  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS EMR Cluster that is not enabled with termination protection.\n\nTermination protection serves as a safeguard against unintentional termination of your clusters. When this feature is enabled, any efforts to terminate the cluster via the AWS Management Console, CLI, or API will be prevented unless the protection is deliberately disabled beforehand. This feature is particularly beneficial for long-running or essential clusters, as accidental termination could lead to data loss or considerable downtime.\n\nIt is advisable to activate termination protection on AWS EMR clusters to prevent accidental terminations.",
