  "description": "This policy identifies GCP VM instances that are assigned a public IP.\n\nUsing a public IP with a GCP VM exposes it directly to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and attacks. This makes the VM vulnerable to threats such as brute force attempts, DDoS attacks, and other malicious activities. To mitigate these risks, it's safer to use private IPs and secure access methods like VPNs or load balancers.\n\nIt is recommended to avoid assigning public IPs to VM instances.",
