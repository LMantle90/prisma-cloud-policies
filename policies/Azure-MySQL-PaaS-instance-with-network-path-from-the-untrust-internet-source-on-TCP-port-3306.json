  "description": "This policy identifies Azure MySQL (PaaS) instance with network path from the untrust internet source on TCP port 3306.\n\nAzure MySQL (PaaS) instance with network path from the untrust internet source on TCP port 3306 may enable bad actors to use brute force or exploit a vulnerability on a system to gain unauthorized access. Further database vulnerabilities or weaknesses could potentially be exploited to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the data stored.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to allow access from Trusted IP list and limit the access from known hosts, services, or specific entities.\n\nNOTE: Prisma Cloud Trusted IP List allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.",
