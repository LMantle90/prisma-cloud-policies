  "description": "This policy identifies Azure roles that contain '*' in Action, and the level of role assignment is Subscription or higher for Azure.\n\nRoles with '*' in the Action section for a subscription or higher scope (like management group) allow users to perform any action on any resource within that scope. This is risky because:\n- Unrestricted Access: Users can bypass security measures and potentially delete critical resources or modify configurations.\n- Accidental Damage: Mistakes can have a significant impact, deleting entire resources or services.\n- Elevated Attack Surface: A compromised account with such a role gives attackers vast control.",
