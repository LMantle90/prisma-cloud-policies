  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Users with Stale Metadata Read Permissions.\n\nEven \"apparently harmless\" permissions like \"Metadata Read\" in GCP IAM can be risky if left unused for 90 days. Here's why:\n\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker could use these credentials to gather information about your GCP environment. This information could include details about project IDs, VM instances, or network configurations. Attackers could exploit this information to identify vulnerabilities or plan further attacks.\nLateral Movement Potential: If attackers compromise an unused GCP user with Metadata Read, they could potentially use it to discover other resources within your GCP project. This could help them move laterally within your environment and gain access to more sensitive data or systems.\nWhile Metadata Read itself doesn't allow direct data manipulation, the information gleaned can be valuable for attackers. Here's how to mitigate the risk:\n\nRegular Review and Removal: Identify and disable unused GCP user accounts and machine identities with any level of Metadata access (Read or Write) on a regular basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Grant only the minimum permissions required for a user or machine identity to function. Metadata Read might not always be necessary.\nMonitor forSuspicious Activity: Utilize Stackdriver Logging to track activity logs, including access attempts for GCP user accounts and service accounts. This can help detect unusual activity related to unused accounts that might indicate a compromise.",

Find the binding between the service account or the user and the role with over-privileged permissions\n4. Remove the binding\n5.
