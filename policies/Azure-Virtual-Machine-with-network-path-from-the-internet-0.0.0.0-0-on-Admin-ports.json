  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machines that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to admin ports. Azure VMs with unrestricted internet access to admin ports may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict Azure VMs with admin ports having unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n\ta) The overly permissive Network Security Group rules can be made more restrictive.\n\tb) Move the instance inside a restrictive subnet if the instance does not need to be publicly accessible.",
