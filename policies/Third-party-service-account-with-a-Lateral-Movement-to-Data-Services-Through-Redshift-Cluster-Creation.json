  "name": "Third-party service account with a Lateral Movement to Data Services Through Redshift Cluster Creation",
  "description": "This policy identifies and mitigates risky behavior where third-party vendors, can create Amazon Redshift clusters and pass IAM roles without 'iam:PassedToService' constraint. Such permissions may allow adversaries to leverage Redshiftâ€™s Default Role and Redshift commands for example 'COPY', enabling lateral movement within your AWS environment. This unauthorized access to sensitive resources through newly established Redshift clusters can compromise data confidentiality and manipulate or expose your cloud infrastructure to potential breaches.",
