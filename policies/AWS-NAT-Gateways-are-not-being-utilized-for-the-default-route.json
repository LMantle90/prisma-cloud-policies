Click on 'Create NAT Gateway', Specify the subnet in which to create the NAT gateway, and select the allocation ID of an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway. When you're done, Click on 'Create a NAT Gateway'. The NAT gateway displays in the console. After a few moments, its status changes to Available, after which it's ready for you to use.\n\nTo update Route Table:\nAfter you've created your NAT gateway, you must update your route tables for your private subnets to point internet traffic to the NAT gateway. We use the most specific route that matches the traffic to determine how to route the traffic.\n1. Sign into the AWS console\n2.
