  "name": "Azure App Service basic authentication enabled",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure App Services which have basic authentication enabled.\n\nBasic Authentication allows local identity management for App Services without using a centralized identity provider like Azure Entra ID, posing a security risk by creating isolated identity systems that lack centralized control and are vulnerable to credential compromise and unauthorized access. Disabling Basic Authentication and integrating with a centralized solution like Azure Entra ID enhances security with stronger authentication, improved access management, and reduced attack risks.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to disable basic authentication for Azure App Services.",
