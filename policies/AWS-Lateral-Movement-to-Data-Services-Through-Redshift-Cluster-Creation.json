Under 'Permissions policies', find the relevant policy according to the alert details and remove the risky actions\n ----------------------------------------\n Remediation steps:\n 1. Log in to the AWS console\n 2. Navigate to the compute service (For example, AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, or AWS ECS) or login to the Okta console\n 3.
