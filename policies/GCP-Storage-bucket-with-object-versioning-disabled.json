  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Storage buckets that have object versioning disabled. \n\nObject versioning is a method of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same storage bucket. Enabling object versioning on storage log buckets will protect your cloud storage data from being overwritten or accidentally deleted.\n\nIt is recommended to enable the object versioning feature on all storage buckets.",
