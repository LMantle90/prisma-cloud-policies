  "description": "GCP GKE Kubernetes services exposed to untrusted internet sources on high-risk ports significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Malicious actors can exploit these exposed services, leading to compromised clusters and sensitive data exposure.\n\nThe GKE service's network configuration allows inbound traffic from untrusted IP addresses on ports typically associated with common attack vectors. This misconfiguration exposes the Kubernetes cluster to various attacks, including brute-force attempts, port scans, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities in applications running within the cluster. Such attacks could result in complete cluster takeover.\n\nImpact includes unauthorized access to applications and data within the GKE cluster, potential data breaches, and disruption of services. Restricting access to trusted sources minimizes the attack surface, enhancing security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.\n\nImplement network policies to restrict inbound traffic to only trusted IP addresses and required ports. Minimize the number of exposed ports and utilize firewalls to filter unwanted traffic. Regularly review and update network configurations to maintain a strong security posture.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict GKE K8s service from having unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the necessary changes and ensure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\na) The overly permissive firewall rules can be made more restrictive.\nb) Move the container/application inside a restrictive subnet if public accessibility is not required.\nc) Remove or disassociate the public IP assigned to the respective container.",
