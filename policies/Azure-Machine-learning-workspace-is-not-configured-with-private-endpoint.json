  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Machine learning workspaces that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoints in workspace resources allow clients on a virtual network to securely access data over Azure Private Link. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Machine learning workspaces.",
