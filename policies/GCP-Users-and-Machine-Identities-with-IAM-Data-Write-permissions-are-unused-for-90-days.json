  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Users with Stale Data Write Permissions.\nGCP user accounts or machine identities with Unused \"Data Write\" permissions, even after 90 days of inactivity, pose a severe security risk:\n\nUnrestricted Data Manipulation: Data Write allows users or machine identities to modify, alter, or even delete critical data stored in GCP services like Cloud Storage buckets or BigQuery datasets. An attacker with these permissions could wreak havoc, corrupting or stealing sensitive information.\nPrivilege Escalation Pathway: Data Write permissions can be a gateway for further compromise. Attackers might exploit them to gain broader control over your GCP resources and access even more critical data or systems.\nImagine giving someone full access to your company files and then forgetting about it. Unused Data Write access is just as dangerous. Here's how to mitigate the risk:\n\nRuthless Review: Aggressively identify and disable all unused GCP user accounts and machine identities with Data Write permissions, regardless of how long they've been inactive.\nLeast Privilege Principle: Grant Data Write permissions only to specific users or machine identities that absolutely require them, and only for the minimum time necessary. Utilize IAM policies for granular control.\nMandatory MFA: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users and service accounts with Data Write permissions. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.",
