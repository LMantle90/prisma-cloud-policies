  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Users with Stale Metadata Write Permissions. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) for access control. Unused GCP user accounts or machine identities with \"Metadata Write\" permissions for 90 days pose a security risk:\nLingering Threat: An attacker could exploit inactive credentials to gain access. Metadata Write allows modifying instance metadata, potentially enabling them to steal data or install malware.\nPrivilege Escalation Risk: With Metadata Write access, attackers might manipulate metadata to elevate their privileges and gain further control over your GCP resources.\n\nUnused privileged accounts are attractive targets. Here's how to mitigate the risk:\nRoutine Review: Regularly identify and disable unused GCP user accounts and machine identities with Metadata Write permissions.\nLeast Privilege Principle: Grant \"Metadata Write\" only when absolutely necessary and for a limited time. Use IAM policies to grant granular permissions.\nMFA Enforcement: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security, especially for service accounts with high-level permissions.",

Find the binding between the service account or the user and the role with over-privileged permissions\n4. Remove the binding\n5. Create a new binding with a predefined or custom role without risky permissions, if necessary.",
