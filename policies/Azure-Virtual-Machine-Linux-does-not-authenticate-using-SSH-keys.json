  "name": "Azure Virtual Machine (Linux) does not authenticate using SSH keys",
  "description": "Azure Virtual Machines (Linux) lacking SSH key authentication are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Basic authentication exposes these machines to unauthorized access attempts.\n\nThe service, Azure Virtual Machines, allows for both password-based and SSH key-based authentication. Disabling password authentication and relying solely on SSH keys significantly reduces the attack surface. Attackers can easily exploit weak or default passwords through brute-force attacks, gaining unauthorized access and potentially compromising sensitive data.\n\nA successful brute-force attack can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and system compromise. Using SSH keys mandates stronger authentication, making brute-forcing significantly more difficult and enhancing overall security posture. This is a crucial best practice for securing Linux-based Virtual Machines.\n\nTo mitigate this misconfiguration, enforce SSH key-based authentication only on all Azure Virtual Machines. Disable password authentication completely. Regularly review and update SSH keys, and use strong, unique keys. Monitor for failed login attempts to detect potential brute-force attacks.",
