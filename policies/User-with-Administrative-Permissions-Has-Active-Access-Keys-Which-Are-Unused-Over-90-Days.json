Examine the user's permissions as well as their role within your organization and determine whether the principle of least privilege is followed\nFor remediation, use the following remediation steps:\nIf access is still required, remove the user's access keys and transition them to AWS's temporary security credentials approach. If any access is deemed unnecessary, remove permissions to minimize the user's access, or remove the user altogether. ",
