  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage Accounts storing Machine Learning workspace high business impact data that are publicly accessible. Azure Storage account stores machine learning artifacts such as job logs. By default, this storage account is used when you upload data to the workspace. The attacker could exploit publicly accessible storage account to get machine learning workspace high business impact data logs and could breach in to the system by leveraging data exposed. It is recommended to restrict storage account access to only to the machine learning services as per business requirement.",
