  "description": "This policy identifies if the AWS Systems Manager patch compliance status is \"NON_COMPLIANT\" with critical or high severity for managed instances. Instances labeled non-compliant might lack essential patches for security, stability, or meeting standards. Non-compliant instances pose security risks because attackers often target unpatched systems to exploit known weaknesses. As a security best practice, it's recommended to apply any missing patches to the affected instances.",
