  "description": "This policy identifies RDS instances that have copy tags to snapshots disabled. Copy tags to snapshots copies all the user-defined tags from the DB instance to snapshots. Copying tags allow you to add metadata and apply access policies to your Amazon RDS resources.\n\nNOTE: Setting Copy tags to snapshots for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB setting. So Aurora DB instances are excluded from policy check.",
