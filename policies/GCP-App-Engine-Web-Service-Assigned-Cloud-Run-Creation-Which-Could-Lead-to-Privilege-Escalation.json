  "description": "An attacker who successfully exploits a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the web service can leverage the permissions associated with the App Engine service. By creating Cloud Run instances with Service Account impersonation privileges they would be able to escalate their permissions creating an instance which performs attacker controlled actions using the permissions of an impersonated Service Account. This would allow them to further enumerate and exploite the environment.",
