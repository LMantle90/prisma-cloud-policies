  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM Groups and Roles with Stale IAM  Metadata Read Permissions.\n\nRisk of Unused Metadata Read Permissions:\nEven seemingly harmless permissions like \"Metadata Read\" in AWS IAM can be risky if left unused for extended periods. Unused IAM groups and roles with IAM  Metadata Read permissions for 90 days present a security concern because:\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker with access to these credentials could use them to gather information about your AWS environment. This information could include project structures, S3 bucket locations, or security group configurations. Attackers could exploit this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities or plan more targeted attacks.\nLateral Movement Potential: A compromised unused group or role with Metadata Read permissions could be a stepping stone for attackers. They might leverage this access to discover and exploit further vulnerabilities within your AWS environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access to more sensitive data or systems.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Regularly identify and remove unused IAM groups and roles with any level of IAM  Metadata access (Read or Write) on a scheduled basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the minimum level of Metadata Read access required for a group or role to function ly. Evaluate if alternative methods, like IAM conditions, can restrict access to specific EC2 instances or S3 buckets.\nMonitor for Suspicious Activity: Utilize CloudTrail to track API calls made within your AWS environment, including those leveraging IAM roles. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused groups or roles that might indicate a compromise.",
