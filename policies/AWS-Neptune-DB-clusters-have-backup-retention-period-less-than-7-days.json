  "description": "This policy identifies Amazon Neptune DB clusters lacking sufficient backup retention tenure.\n\nAWS Neptune DB is a fully managed graph database service. The backup retention period denotes the duration for storing automated backups of the Neptune DB clusters. Inadequate retention periods heighten the risk of data loss, and compliance issues, and hinder effective recovery in security breaches or system failures.\n\nIt is recommended to ensure a backup retention period of at least 7 days or according to your business and compliance requirements.",
