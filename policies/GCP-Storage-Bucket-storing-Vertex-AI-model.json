  "name": "GCP Storage Bucket storing Vertex AI model",
  "description": "GCP Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets storing Vertex AI models could pose a significant security risk. These buckets, often containing sensitive intellectual property, become accessible to unauthorized individuals if misconfigured.\n\nVertex AI models, excluding AutoML models, are stored within GCS buckets. Improper configuration, such as insufficient access controls, allows malicious actors to download the models, potentially leading to intellectual property theft, unauthorized model usage, and revenue loss. Attackers could reverse-engineer the model, replicate its functionality, or use it for malicious purposes.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration is the potential exposure of sensitive AI models, resulting in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and competitive disadvantages. Maintaining strict access controls to GCS buckets is crucial to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized access. Properly configured storage ensures confidentiality and integrity of valuable AI assets.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, ensure all GCS buckets storing Vertex AI models have private access settings. Regularly review and audit bucket permissions, restricting access only to authorized users and services. Employ strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication, to further strengthen security.",
