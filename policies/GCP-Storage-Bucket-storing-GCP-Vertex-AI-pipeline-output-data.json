This output data is considered sensitive and confidential intellectual property and its storage location should be checked regularly. The storage location should be as per the organization's security and compliance requirements.\n\nIt is recommended to monitor, identify, and evaluate storage location for GCP Vertex AI pipeline output data regularly to prevent unauthorized access and AI model thefts.",
