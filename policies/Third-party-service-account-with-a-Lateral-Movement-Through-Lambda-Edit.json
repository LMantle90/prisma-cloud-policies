  "description": "This policy detects when third-party vendors are granted permissions to manage access to Lambda functions and pass IAM roles. Specifically, the 'lambda:AddPermission' action enables these accounts to grant execution permissions on Lambda functions to other AWS services, accounts, or organizations, potentially broadening access to sensitive functions. Additionally, the ability to 'iam:PassRole' can allow third-party accounts to assign roles that expand the permissions available to those entities. ",
