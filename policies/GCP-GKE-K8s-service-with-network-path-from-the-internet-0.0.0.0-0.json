  "name": "GCP GKE K8s service with network path from the internet (0.0.0.0/0)",
  "description": "GCP GKE Kubernetes services directly exposed to the internet via a 0.0.0.0/0 network path pose a significant security risk. These exposed services create a large attack surface, vulnerable to unauthorized access and various attacks.\n\nGKE clusters typically use virtual networks and firewalls. Allowing unrestricted internet access to a Kubernetes service bypasses these security controls. Attackers can easily exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete cluster compromise.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration could be severe, ranging from data exfiltration to complete system compromise. Restricting access to only trusted IP addresses or specific networks minimizes the attack surface and improves overall security posture. Proactive mitigation is crucial to prevent exploitation.\n\nImplement robust network segmentation and access controls. Restrict network access to the GKE cluster and its services using firewall rules and only allow traffic from trusted IP addresses or specific networks. Regularly review and update these rules. Avoid exposing services directly to the internet unless absolutely necessary.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict GKE K8s service from having unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n a) The overly permissive firewall rules can be made more restrictive.\n b) Move the container/app inside a restrictive subnet if it does not need to be publicly accessible.\n c) Restrict the IP addresses or IP ranges that can access your service.",
