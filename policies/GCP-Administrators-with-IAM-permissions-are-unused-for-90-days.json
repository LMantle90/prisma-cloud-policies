  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Administrators with Stale IAM Permissions (Unused for 90 days).\n\nRisk of Unused IAM Permissions:\nGCP Service Accounts and Users with any level of IAM permissions (administrative or otherwise) that haven't been used for 90 days pose a security risk because:\nUnsecured Access Point: These identities act like forgotten backdoors. If compromised, attackers can exploit them to gain access to GCP resources and perform unauthorized actions, potentially leading to data breaches, disrupting critical services, or incurring unexpected charges.\nElevated Attack Potential: IAM permissions can vary widely, with some granting high-level access to modify configurations, create new resources, or manage IAM policies. If compromised, an unused account with such permissions could be devastating.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Proactively identify and remove unused GCP Service Accounts and Users on a regular basis (ideally less than 90 days). Focus on identities with any level of IAM permissions, not just those with administrative privileges.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: When creating GCP Service Accounts and Users, assign only the minimum permissions required for them to perform their specific tasks. Regularly review and adjust permissions as needed.\nService Account Keys: For service accounts, manage and rotate service account keys securely. Avoid storing keys in long-lived locations or embedding them directly in code.\nIAM User Access Review: Utilize GCP IAM Recommender to identify and flag unused IAM Users and Service Accounts for review and potential removal.\nMonitor for Suspicious Activity: Utilize Stackdriver Logging to track activity logs, including access attempts for GCP Service Accounts and Users. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused accounts that might indicate a compromise.",
