  "description": "This policy identifies AWS EventBridge event buses with no resource-based policy attached.\n\nAWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that enables businesses to quickly and easily integrate applications, services, and data across multiple cloud environments. By default, an EventBridge custom event bus lacks a resource-based policy associated with it, which allows principals in the account to access the event bus.Â \n\nIt is recommended to attach a resource based policy to the event bus to limit access scope to fewer entities.",
