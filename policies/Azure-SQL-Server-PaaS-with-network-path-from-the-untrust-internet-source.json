  "description": "This policy identifies Azure SQL Server (PaaS) with network path from the untrust internet source.\n\nAzure SQL Server (PaaS) with network path from the untrust internet source may enable bad actors to use brute force or exploit a vulnerability on a system to gain unauthorized access. Further database vulnerabilities or weaknesses could potentially be exploited to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the data stored.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to allow access from Trusted IP list and limit the access from known hosts, services, or specific entities.\n\nNOTE: Prisma Cloud Trusted IP List allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.",
