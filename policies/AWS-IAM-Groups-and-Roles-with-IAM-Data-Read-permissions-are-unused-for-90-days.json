  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM Groups and Roles with Stale IAM Effective Data Read Permissions.\n\nRisk of Unused Data Read Permissions:\nEven seemingly innocuous permissions like \"Data Read\" in AWS IAM can be risky if left unused for extended periods. Unused IAM groups and roles with IAM effective Data Read permissions for 90 days present a security concern because:\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker with access to these credentials could use them to gather sensitive details about your AWS environment. This information could include data storage locations (S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables), IAM user details, or security group configurations. Attackers could exploit this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities or plan more targeted attacks.\nPotential Stepping Stone: A compromised unused group or role with Data Read permissions could be a stepping stone for attackers. They might leverage this access to discover and exploit further vulnerabilities within your AWS environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access to more sensitive data or systems.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Regularly identify and remove unused IAM groups and roles with any level of IAM effective Data Read permissions (Read or Write) on a scheduled basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the minimum level of Data Read access required for a group or role to function effectively. Evaluate if alternative methods, like IAM conditions or resource-based policies, can restrict access to specific S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, or other data sources.\nMonitor for Suspicious Activity: Utilize CloudTrail to track API calls made within your AWS environment, including those leveraging IAM roles. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused groups or roles that might indicate a compromise.",
