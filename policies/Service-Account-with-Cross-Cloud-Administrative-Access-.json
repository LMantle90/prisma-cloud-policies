Examine the role's trust relationship and permissions as well as its use case \nIn order to remove any unnecessary permissions and minimize trusted entities which can assume the role, use the following remediation steps: \nTo revoke the cross cloud service account access to assume the role altogether, browse to the role in the AWS Console and select \"Trust relationships\"->\"Edit trust policy\". Modify the role's trust relationship as per requirements. To minimize the access the service account has when using the role, under the \"Permissions\" tab, select the relevant policy granting administrative permissions and remove those which are unnecessary by either editing the policy or replacing it (notice: editing a managed policy could affect other roles).",
