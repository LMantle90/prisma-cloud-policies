  "description": "Improperly configured AWS S3 buckets hosting websites pose a significant security risk, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. These buckets, if misconfigured, can expose data publicly without proper authentication or authorization.\n\nThe service involves configuring AWS S3 buckets to host websites using the 'website' configuration setting. Failure to restrict website hosting to only authorized buckets increases the risk of data breaches. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the bucket.\n\nA successful exploit could lead to data exfiltration, reputational damage, and potential financial losses due to regulatory non-compliance. Restricting website hosting to explicitly authorized buckets ensures only intended content is publicly accessible, minimizing the attack surface and strengthening data security.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, regularly review and update S3 bucket configurations. Enable strong access controls, such as restricting bucket policies and using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to limit access. Disable website hosting for any bucket not explicitly designed to host a website.",
