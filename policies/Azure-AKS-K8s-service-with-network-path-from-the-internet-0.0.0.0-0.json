  "description": "This policy identifies Azure AKS K8s services with network path from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).\n\nContainer services exposed to the internet increases the risk of unauthorized access, cyber attacks, and data breaches, as they present a larger attack surface for malicious actors. These services are particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.\n\nAs a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit access to trusted hosts, services, or specific entities.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict AKS K8s service from having unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n a) The overly permissive network security group rules can be made more restrictive.\n b) Move the container/app service inside a restrictive subnet if it does not need to be publicly accessible.\n c) Remove or disassociate the public IP assigned to the respective K8s service.",
