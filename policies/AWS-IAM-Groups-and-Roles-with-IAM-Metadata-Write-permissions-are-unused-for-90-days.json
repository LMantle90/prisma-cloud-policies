  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM Groups and Roles with Stale IAM  Metadata Write Permissions.\n\nRisk of Unused Metadata Write Permissions:\nIAM groups and roles with Unused IAM  Metadata Write permissions for 90 days pose a security risk because:\n\nInformation Gathering Tool: An attacker with access to these credentials could leverage them to gather details about your AWS environment. This information could include instance IDs, security group configurations, or IAM user details. Attackers could exploit this knowledge to identify vulnerabilities or plan further intrusions.\nPotential Privilege Escalation: If compromised, unused roles with Metadata Write permissions could be used by attackers to escalate privileges within your AWS environment. They might exploit these permissions to gain access to more sensitive resources or perform unauthorized actions.\n\nMitigating the Risk:\nRegular Review and Removal: Proactively identify and remove unused IAM groups and roles with any level of IAM  Metadata access (Read or Write) on a regular basis.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Always adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM permissions. Grant only the minimum level of Metadata Write access required for a group or role to function ly. Evaluate if alternative methods, like IAM conditions, can restrict access to specific EC2 instances.\nMonitor for Unusual Activity: Utilize CloudTrail to track API calls made within your AWS environment, including those leveraging IAM roles. This vigilance can help detect unusual activity related to unused roles that might indicate a compromise.",
