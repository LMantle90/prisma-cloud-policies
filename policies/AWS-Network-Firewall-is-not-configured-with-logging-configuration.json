  "name": "AWS Network Firewall is not configured with logging configuration",
  "description": "This policy identifies an AWS Network Firewall where logging is not configured.\n\nAWS Network Firewall manages inbound and outbound traffic for the AWS resources within the AWS environment. Logging configuration for the network firewall involves enabling logging of network traffic, including allowed and denied requests, to provide visibility into network activity. Failure to configure logging results in a lack of visibility into potential security threats, making it difficult to detect and respond to malicious activity effectively and hindering threat detection and compliance.\n\nIt is recommended to enable logging to ensure comprehensive monitoring, threat detection, compliance adherence, and effective incident response.",

For more information about stateful rules and rule groups, see Rule groups in AWS Network Firewall.\n\nFlow – Sends logs for all network traffic that the stateless engine forwards to the stateful rules engine.\n\n6. For each selected log type, choose the destination type, then provide the information for the logging destination that you prepared following the guidance in Firewall logging destinations.\n7. Choose 'Save' to save your changes and return to the firewall's detail page.",
