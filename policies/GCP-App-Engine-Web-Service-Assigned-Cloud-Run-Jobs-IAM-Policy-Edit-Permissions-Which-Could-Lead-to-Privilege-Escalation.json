  "description": "An attacker who successfully exploits a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the web service can leverage the permissions associated with the App Engine service. By editing the IAM policy for Cloud Run Jobs, in conjunction with Service Account impersonation privileges they will be able to escalate their permissions by adding edit permissions to an instance, causing it to perform attacker controlled actions using the permissions of an impersonated Service Account. This would allow them to further enumerate and exploite the environment.",
