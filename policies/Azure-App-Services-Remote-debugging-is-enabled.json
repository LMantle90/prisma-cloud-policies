  "description": "Azure App Services with remote debugging enabled pose a significant security risk. Enabling this feature opens inbound network ports, creating a potential attack vector for unauthorized access.\n\nRemote debugging allows developers to connect to and troubleshoot applications running within Azure App Services. However, leaving this feature enabled after development exposes the application to potential exploitation via these open ports from untrusted IPs. Attackers could exploit this access to gain unauthorized control or steal sensitive data.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration could range from data breaches and service disruptions to complete application compromise. Disabling remote debugging after development is a crucial security best practice, minimizing the attack surface and protecting the application from external threats.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, disable remote debugging on Azure App Services once development and testing are complete. Regularly review App Service configurations to ensure this setting remains disabled unless explicitly required for troubleshooting. Implement robust network security controls, including firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to further enhance protection.",
